### **Step 2: Start Customer Outreach (TODAY)**

**LinkedIn Message Template:**
> Hi [Name], I noticed your Shopify store and wanted to share something that could save you serious money. 
>
> Most stores lose 20-30% revenue to stockouts they never see coming. I built an AI system that predicts this before it happens.
>
> Here's a live demo: [YOUR-DEPLOYED-URL]
>
> This example store was about to lose $6,000+ this month from just 3 items. Want to see what your store looks like? Takes 5 minutes to analyze.

**Reddit Strategy:**
- Answer inventory questions in r/shopify
- Share helpful tips, mention your tool naturally
- DM store owners struggling with stockouts

### **Step 3: Book Demo Calls**
**Target:** 5 demos this week = 2-3 beta customers at $49/month
