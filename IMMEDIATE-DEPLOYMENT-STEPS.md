>
> Here's a live demo: https://[YOUR-RAILWAY-URL]
> 
> This fashion store was about to lose $6,014 this month from just 3 items. Want to see what your numbers look like? Takes 5 minutes to connect.

### **Reddit Reply Template:**
> I actually built a tool for exactly this problem! Check out https://[YOUR-VERCEL-URL] - it shows a demo store that was about to lose $6K+ to stockouts they couldn't predict. The AI catches these before they happen.
